# One Moon Restaurant (README)

This repository is made as a demonstration of Python skills.
The files are made in accordance to examples and exercises present in Katie Cunningham's book "SamsTeachYourself Python in 24 Hours".
All examples and exercises from the books are expanded and improved in the repository.
For each chapter in the book denoted by "Hour", the repository is updated every week (tentatively).

The repository hosts .py scripts and code snippets related to managing a hypothetical restaurant named "One Moon Restaurant".
The food recipes and ingredients used for the codes are from Genshin Impact, not from the book.
